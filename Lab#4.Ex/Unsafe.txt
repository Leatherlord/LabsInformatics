We had 2 bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, 5 sheets of high powered blotter acid,
a salt shaker 0.5 full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers...
And also a 0.25 of tequila, a 0.25 of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and 2 dozen amyls.
Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection,
the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
