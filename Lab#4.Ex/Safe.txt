We had 17 bags of grass, 16880 pellets of mescaline, 80 sheets of high powered blotter acid,
a salt shaker 5.80 full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers...
And also a 5.1880 of tequila, a 5.1880 of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and 17 dozen amyls.
Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection,
the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
