My informatics labs

### Lab#4 
Easy parser/converter from JSON to YAML. 
 - main.py - low level algorythm without imports that only works with structures of the same type as dataIn.json
 - secondary.py - universal algorithm
 
 ### Lab#4.Ex
 Some regular expressions
 - Time.py - replaces every "TIME" with "(TBD)" ("TIME" - HH:MM or HH:MM:SS)
 - TwoComas.py - finds every sentence with 2 or more comas
 - Safety.py - replaces every integer with its 3*x^2+5
